# Running a PyRossGeo simulation

PyRossGeo simulations are defined using configuration





**Caution:** <i>At the moment PyRossGeo does not have any checks in place to detect formatting errors in the configuration files. Any mistakes in the configuration files may lead to uncaught exceptions or unexpected simulation behaviour.</i>
